## Description
This repository contains codes and data for the paper:  
Doba, T.\*; Harabuchi, Y.; Nagata, Y.; Maeda, S.\* Construction of an Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Yield Prediction and Mechanistic Elucidation Enabled by Global Reaction Route Mapping. **2025**

This repository is organized into three directories:
- calculation
- experiment
- machine-learning

Each directory includes a README file with additional information.
The code has been modified from its initial version, while maintaining the core functionality.
It has only been tested in the computer environment listed below and may require minor adjustments to run on other systems.

## Requirements
- GRRM23 developmental version
- Gaussian 16
